# SOBay
In order for the application to be operational, we need to add a few features to comply with the copyright held by the teachers on the original files used in the project.

## Promoters
We need to create a few promoters in the folder `binaries/promoters`, which should print to the console random promotions of the specified format (`<category> <discount> <duration>`) listed one per line and in a random interval of time. The promoters to be used should be listed in the file `binaries/files/promotores.txt`, with each promoter name (which must be located in `binaries/promoters/`) listed one per line.

## Users
We need to create a library, `users_lib.o`, located at `backend/users/`, that exports all the functions listed in `users_lib.h`. The users list should be located in `binaries/files/users.txt`, with each user listed in the format `<username> <password> <balance>`. Read `users_lib.h`, located at `backend/users/`, for more information.
